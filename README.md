### BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING

Improving traffic safety is a significant concern for any large city. In 2018, the U.S. alone saw 36,560 fatalities related to car crashes. To address and reduce these fatalities, initiatives like Vision Zero have been launched. Cities such as New York and Chicago have adopted this initiative to enhance traffic safety. The fundamental principle of Vision Zero is that traffic crashes are preventable, and even one fatality is too many.

The goal of this project is to create a predictive model that can analyze the primary causes of car crashes. An accurate model can help city authorities take effective measures to prevent crashes. By understanding the reasons behind accidents, cities can strategize and implement targeted actions to reduce the occurrence of such incidents. In this project, I will analyze car crash data from Chicago to develop a predictive model for the causes of crashes and identify trends in these incidents.
